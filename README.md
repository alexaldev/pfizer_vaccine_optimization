# pfizer_vaccine_optimization
Project to solve the 'Reverse Engineering Source Code of the Biontech Pfizer Vaccine' found here [here](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/part-2-reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/).
The project is under construction, follows some OOP principles. 
There has been no sophisticated optimization yet that has provided a good enough success rate, besides the GC optimization described in the paper. 
The current top success rate achieved is ~56%.
